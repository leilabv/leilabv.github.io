EGO (2015)
In psychology the mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of objectification, the Ego being the result of a conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan called alienation.

The interactive installation EGO re-stages and reverses the process of alienation by enhancing and deforming the mirror image by the movements of the users.
Although an abstraction, it quickly becomes the self and reestablishes the tension between the real and the symbolic, the Ego and the It, the subject and the object.
