4 COLORS is an interactive audiovisual installation that lets the user modulate 4 sounds in various ways. The immersive mirror visualization gives an easy understandable indication of how to interact with the sound environment. Whenever the user(s) leave(s) the interactive zone, a new set of sounds is loaded.
The closer and more movement the bigger the color blob = higher volume.
Y position controls parameters such as pitch, filter cutoff, LFO speed, etc. of the 4 sound parts.

The ambient sound is faded in and out by the overall distance. Like a lot of my work, it involves body movement, sounds and visuals to create a holistic experience.
